    <h1> San Francisco: the best and the worst.</h1>
    <h2> Chinatown </h2>
    <p>
      It's dirty and dark which is why I enjoy walking through there at <strong>night</strong>.

    <h2> Tenderloin </h2>
    <p>
      The food is amazing but the amount of crap you find on the streets can be overwhelming. The homeless and drug addicted population is pretty <em>vile</em> too.
